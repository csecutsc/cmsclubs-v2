## How to run locally

### Pre-empt

- This requires [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) to run, and having the right schema for the templating on this site
  - You can remove `/sections/home/events`, `/sections/home/calendar` & `/sections/home/clubs`
    from `/pages/index.jsx` for it work without crashing and burning.
- This platform covers the general use components, for more specific components such as `Footer`, `Navigation`, look at the code
  - The purpose of this is to provide documentation for users adding to the site. It's unlikely you need to touch the other components
- For more information, such as specifics for schema - please contact CSEC.

### Gatsby

1.  First install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), I recommend node 14, but the LTS would do as well.
2.  Clone the <a href={repository.url} target="_blank">repository</a>.
3.  Prepare the `.env` file based off of the `.env.sample`. (Shouldn't work properly without the right schema)
4.  `npm ci` & `npm start` - You are ready to start developing

### Storybook

Assuming you have done the steps above (minus 3, thats not important for this,
and `npm start`). You should be able to run `npm run storybook`.

## Development server

To connect multiple servers, and implement hot reloading as needed, we use `concurrently` to run multiple "services" at once.
The following services we have running are codegen, storybook, gatsby, and netlify lambdas.

Therefore, when `npm start` is used, the following steps are taken
 - `codegen` is run initially to prepare any files which are dependencies for certain services
 - Concurrently is run which performs the following
    - `codegen`: Runs again (No way to avoid that), then watches for file changes in `/codegen` using `nodemon`.
    - `storybook`: Starts the Storybook development server. This can be accessed via `http://localhost:8001`.
    - `gatsby`: Starts the Gatsby development server. This can be accessed via `http://localhost:8000`.
    - `lambda`: Prepares the lambda server dependencies via `npm ci`, and runs `npm run start` in `/lambdas/package.json`.
