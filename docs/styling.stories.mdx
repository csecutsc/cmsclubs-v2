### Learn about the sass and design principles

<div style={{ margin: `2rem 0` }} />

## SCSS variables vs. CSS variables

We use a mixture of the two where,

- CSS variables are used for colors only
- SCSS variables are for other things such as font name, and measurement related stuff.

CSS vars are heavier vs SCSS vars as one is prebuilt and static, but one adds another layer of processing by the CSS engine but is dynamic.
(Performance different is not too big, but it varies on situations... Deep propogation of css vars are usually the heaviest)

<div style={{ margin: `3rem 0` }} />

| File               | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_animations.scss` | Contains reused `@keyframes` stuff                                                                                                                            |
| `_colors.scss`     | Autogenerated. Contains our colors, returns an `init` function for loading colors into css vars                                                               |
| `_fonts.scss`      | Autogenerated. Contains our `@font-face`, returns an `init` function for loading `@font-face`. Also shares the `$font` variable which is the font-family name |
| `_mixins.scss`     | Contains our mixins... If you need an explaination, then you need to learn scss first.                                                                        |
| `_units.scss`      | Contains our variables for stuff like font sizes, spacing stuff, etc. Note everything on this site uses **ONLY** these vars for stuff like padding/margin     |
| `index.scss`       | Contains our root stylesheet which is required only once and sits on the root of the project - is used by `Layout`.                                           |
