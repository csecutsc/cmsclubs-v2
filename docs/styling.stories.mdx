## SCSS variables vs. CSS variables

We use a mixture of the two where,

- CSS variables are used for colors only
- SCSS variables are for other things such as font name, and measurement related stuff.

CSS vars are heavier vs SCSS vars as one is prebuilt and static, but one adds another layer of processing by the CSS engine but is dynamic.
(Performance different is not too big, but it varies on situations... Deep propogation of css vars are usually the heaviest)

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_animations.scss` | Contains reused `@keyframes` stuff                                                                                                                            |
| `_colors.scss`     | Autogenerated. Contains our colors, returns an `init` function for loading colors into css vars                                                               |
| `_fonts.scss`      | Autogenerated. Contains our `@font-face`, returns an `init` function for loading `@font-face`. Also shares the `$font` variable which is the font-family name |
| `_mixins.scss`     | Contains our mixins... If you need an explaination, then you need to learn scss first.                                                                        |
| `_units.scss`      | Contains our variables for stuff like font sizes, spacing stuff, etc. Note everything on this site uses **ONLY** these vars for stuff like padding/margin     |
| `index.scss`       | Contains our root stylesheet which is required only once and sits on the root of the project - is used by `Layout`.                                           |

## Important notes

- Use `rem` instead of something like `em` or `px/pt` (God forbid u use `cm/inch` - I will find you and I will vote you out the airlock).
  - `em` is nice, however it's lack of `r` means that the `em` isnt tied to a centralized source - which is what we want
  - `px/pt` straightup has no responsiveness, hence requires alot of media queries to maintain... Not ideal as it adds bulk to the CSS and requires
    extra effort to keep consistent.
  - `%/vh/vw` is okay if you require some sort of decentralized relative unit of measurement.
- Use `@mixins.transitions` instead of defining it yourself. It has some minor stuff which applies the transition later, which lets us do some cool stuff now/later
  - We can disable animations at will to help with lower end devices (We can add this one day... and do stuff like check for `prefers-reduced-motion`)
  - This split second of disabled animations is key for allowing darkmode users from not being flash banged one load (Trust me it does wonders)
    - You can also disabled this skip if you need so (Not sure why... but hey its there!)
  - It allows for us to consistency use the same speeds and ease... it also saves you work so why complain!
- Do not touch the scss files in `docs` & `.storybook` unless if you know what you are doing
