## Purpose of Lambdas

This contains our serverless functions for any connections to third party applications, such as GraphCMS. Some of the purpose include
 - Proxying requests to protect sensative information such as endpoints and tokens for our frontend applications
 - Proving additional services such as webhooks for integrations with application such as GraphCMS

You can learn a bit more about the configuration via reading the docs from Netlify and Gatsby respectively.
